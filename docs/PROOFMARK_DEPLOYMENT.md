# Proofmark — Deployment Guide

Where the contract is deployed, how to deploy it again, and how to verify a
deployment actually succeeded.

## Live deployments

| Network | Chain ID | Contract address | Deployed | E2E verified |
|---------|----------|------------------|----------|--------------|
| StudioNet | 61999 | `0x605e5BE4a8013B2B6c70c4BECa3CEbB7BD7918e4` | 2026-09-03 | ✅ **28/28 steps** — full lifecycle (`e2e/results/studionet-e2e.log`) |
| Testnet Bradbury | 4221 | `0x79C15889D5070321176994373C440778a9eC47c1` | 2026-09-03 | deploy verified by reads (no full e2e on Bradbury — StudioNet covers the scenario) |

> These are the **canonical, latest** addresses — both deployed 2026-09-03 from
> the **Shape A hardened** `intelligent-contracts/proofmark.py` (self-buy ban, epoch
> deadline compare + 60 s minimum horizon, coverage capped to 10% of the tier
> pool). The prior generation (`0xED90…` StudioNet, `0xcBF4…` Bradbury,
> deployed 2026-09-02) runs the unpatched source and should **not** be used.

- Deploy account (`default`): `0xa881365a99d77be904e414ae610e22938bb0466d`
- Deploy txs (proof they finalized): StudioNet
  `0xf8e416dc78f142cff43a7efe05b59e62f2d5b0b6ad6602e18401938c6373d8fe`;
  Bradbury
  `0x14222a1446ade8c71f224b889693bf736c090c824ee17f68e67952a03832350a`.
- The full 28-step StudioNet run exercised register, LP deposit, quoting,
  2× payable policy issuance, deliverable submit, all negative/gate reverts
  (now including past **and** sub-60 s deadlines), expire, auto-breach claim +
  payout, counters, and LP withdraw to pool 0.
- The earlier-generation Bradbury roundtrip proved value moves **in and back
  out** on a successful payable pair (deposit 1 GEN → pool 1 GEN → withdraw
  1 GEN → pool 0); this generation is verified on Bradbury by reads/writes only.

## Frontend environment variables

The Next.js frontend reads these at build time (set them in Vercel). The live
Vercel deployment points at **StudioNet** (gasless):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROOFMARK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x605e5BE4a8013B2B6c70c4BECa3CEbB7BD7918e4
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROOFMARK_NETWORK=studionet
```

If you'd rather run the frontend against **Bradbury** (no rate limits), swap in
its deployment instead — both are verified live:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROOFMARK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x79C15889D5070321176994373C440778a9eC47c1
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROOFMARK_NETWORK=testnet-bradbury
```

Network values follow the `genlayer-js/chains` names: `studionet`,
`testnetBradbury`, `testnetAsimov`. Note StudioNet is rate-limited (60 req/min
per IP) — fine for a demo dashboard, but batch scripts should use Bradbury.

## How to deploy again

Prerequisite: `genlayer` CLI installed and `genlayer account unlock` run for the
deploying account.

```bash
# 1. Pick the network
genlayer network set studionet            # gasless, but rate-limited
genlayer network set testnet-bradbury     # needs GEN in the account

# 2. Deploy from the repo root
genlayer deploy --contract intelligent-contracts/proofmark.py

# 3. Record the returned Contract Address + Transaction Hash
```

StudioNet is gasless (0 GEN balance is fine). Bradbury needs GEN — claim from
the faucet if the account is empty: https://testnet-faucet.genlayer.foundation/

## How to verify a deployment (do not skip)

`ACCEPTED` / `FINALIZED` transaction status does **not** mean the contract code
executed. A failed execution still finalizes, but no contract is created. Verify
with reads and a write, not just the deploy banner:

```bash
# Read: should return a fresh pool
genlayer call <ADDRESS> get_pool_info --args "unrated"

# Write: should be accepted by consensus
genlayer write <ADDRESS> register --args "agent-smoke"

# Read back: profile should exist with your account as owner
genlayer call <ADDRESS> get_profile --args "agent-smoke"
```

On StudioNet, `genlayer schema` and `genlayer code` are **not supported** — the
network rejects those RPCs. The receipt plus working view/write calls are the
proof. The receipt can be checked with:

```bash
genlayer receipt <TX_HASH> --stdout --stderr
```

## Network quirks learned on this machine

- **StudioNet RPC is flaky.** Reads/writes sometimes fail with `ECONNRESET` or
  an SSL `invalid session id` error. Retry — they succeed on the next attempt.
- **StudioNet rate limits:** 60 req/min, 1000 req/hr per IP. Throttle batch
  scripts and wait for receipts between writes.
- **Bradbury receipt polling** can take a while to reach `FINALIZED`; reads and
  writes work immediately after deployment anyway.
